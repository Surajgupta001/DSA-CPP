# ASCII

- ASCII, stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- It is a 7-bit character code where each individual bit represents a unique character.
- This page shows the extended ASCII table which is based on the Windows-1252 character set which is an 8 bit ASCII table with 256 characters and symbols
- It includes all ASCII codes from standard ASCII, and it is a superset of ISO 8859-1 in terms of printable characters
- In the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), ISO/IEC 8859-1 has invisible control characters, while Windows-1252 has writable characters
- Windows-1252 is probably the most-used 8-bit character encoding in the world.

## What is character encoding?

- Character encoding plays a fundamental role when you want to understand the ASCII table.

- You may ask why.

- Well, character encoding basically means, giving numbers to the alphabet.

- You may ask why anyone would go through the hassle of numbering each character.

- Let me remind you of something. Computers are nothing but powerful calculators which works on the basic principle of calculation.

- And when you assign them numbers, converting them to binaries is quite easy.

In the English language, we have 26 characters so if we assign them numbers, it should look like this:

| Character | Encoded Number | Binary conversion |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| L         | 12             | 00001100          |
| H         | 8              | 00001000          |
| B         | 2              | 00000010          |

Here, I gave numbers to L, H, and B and later converted them to binary, which made the whole calculation quite easy and efficient.  

That was more of a basic part. Now, let's jump to the ASCII table.

## Alphabets

- In the last portion of the ASCII table, you will find the alphabet in capital and small letters.

- Uppercase letters will range from 65 to 90
Whereas the lowercase case letters will range from 97 to 122

## Wrapping Up

- In this guide, I went through how you can understand the ASCII table by dividing it into small parts.
