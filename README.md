## üìñ How to Use This Repository

Each lecture directory (e.g., `Lecture 12(Array-1)/`) contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) related to the topic of that lecture. You can browse through the directories to find code examples for specific data structures or algorithms.

The code is intended for educational purposes and can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler (like g++).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compiling and Running Code

To compile and run a C++ file, use the following command in your terminal (replace `filename.cpp` with your file):

```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output.exe
./output.exe
```

Or, if you are using Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
g++ filename.cpp -o output.exe
./output.exe
```

You can also use the provided VS Code build tasks for easier compilation.

## üíª Prerequisites & Recommended Tools

- **C++ Compiler:** [g++ (MinGW for Windows)](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- **Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C/C++ extension
- **Git:** For version control and collaboration
- **Basic C++ knowledge** is recommended
