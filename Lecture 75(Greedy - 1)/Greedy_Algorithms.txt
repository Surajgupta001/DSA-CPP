Master HEAP: Understanding 4 patterns where HEAP data structure is used

What is Heap?
1.It is mainly used to represent a priority queue.
2. It is represented as a Binary Tree (a tree structure where a node of a tree has a maximum of two child nodes). Heaps are complete binary trees.
3. A simple array can be used to represent a Heap where array indices refer to the node position in the tree.
4 .Parent and child nodes can be accessed with indices:
    A root node｜i = 0, the first item of the array
    A parent node｜parent(i) = i / 2
    A left child node｜left(i) = 2i
    A right child node｜right(i)=2i+1
5. Two type of Heaps — Min Heap, Max Heap
    Min Heap — the parent node always has a smaller value than the child nodes.
    Max Heap — the parent node is always larger than the child node value.

Problem Patterns where HEAP is used
Based on my understanding, different questions where HEAP is common data structure to use can be categorized in following 4 categories:


1. Top K Pattern
2. Merge K Sorted Pattern
3. Two Heaps Pattern
4. Minimum Number Pattern
All questions under one patterns has some similarities in terms of using HEAP as a data structure. Completing these questions would gurantee you mastery on the HEAP data structure. Below list includes some of the most common questions asked in most of the companies.


Top K Pattern
LC #215 - Kth largest number in an array
LC #973 - K closest points to origin
LC #347 - Top k frequent elements/numbers
LC #692 - Top k frequent words
LC #264 - Ugly Number II
LC #451 - Frequency Sort
LC #703 - Kth largest number in a stream
LC #767 - Reorganize String
LC #358 - Rearrange string K distance apart
LC #1439 - Kth smallest sum of a matrix with sorted rows


Merge K sorted pattern
LC #23 - Merge K sorted
LC #373 - K pairs with the smallest sum
LC #378 - K smallest numbers in M-sorted lists


Two Heaps Pattern
LC #295 - Find median from a data stream
LC #480 - Sliding window Median
LC #502 - Maximize Capital/IPO


Minimum number Pattern
LC #1167 - Minimum Cost to connect sticks/ropes
LC #253 - Meeting Rooms II
LC #759 - Employee free time
LC #857 - Minimumcost to hire K workers
LC #621 - Minimum number of CPU (Task scheduler)
LC #871 - Minimum number of Refueling stops
