What -> User made data structure.
why -> Range queries questions can be solved very efficiently using segment trees.

what is segment trees ?
-> Segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a segment of the array.
-> Each node in the segment tree contains the information of the segment it represents.
-> The root node represents the entire array.
-> The left child of a node represents the left half of the segment represented by the node.
-> The right child of a node represents the right half of the segment represented by the node.
-> The leaf nodes represent the individual elements of the array.
-> The segment tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into two halves until each element is a leaf
